Unibuddy: Student Tasks Automator  turns scattered syllabi, emails, and LMS announcements into one unified timeline (This week/Next week), a priority-sorted task list (exams > labs > assignments), .ICS calendar exports with built-in reminders, and email reminders for crunch time. A hackathon project built for university students
